# KiCad-PCB-design-workshop
This repo contains most of the files related to my PCB design workshop using KiCad. Learn how you can build a simple PCB and then continue with easily building a more complex LED project.

In addition, clone this repo to your computer as well to get the needed KiCad symbols, footprints and 3D models for the workshop:

## Also, check out these plugins for KiCad

**kicad-jlcpcb-tools**

Plugin to generate BOM + CPL files for JLCPCB, assign LCSC part numbers directly from the plugin, query the JLCPCB parts database, lookup datasheets and much more.
