# KiCad-PCB-design-workshop
This repo contains most of the files related to my PCB design workshop using KiCad. Learn how you can build a simple PCB and then continue with easily building a more complex LED project.

In addition, clone this repo to your computer as well to get the needed KiCad symbols, footprints and 3D models for the workshop:
